                        <p>Dermapen excels when used as a treatment for fine lines and wrinkles. As the Dermapen glides over your skin, it creates
                          micro-point punctures in the skin, the majority of which are simply pushing your pores open temporarily. This is perceived
                          by the defense mechanism of your body as a damage which needs to be repair, and stimulates the release of growth factors that
                          trigger the production of collagen and elastin.</p>

                        <strong>Derma Roller</strong>

                          regenerate and repair itself naturally and safely, creating smoother, brighter, healthier, younger-looking skin. Dermaroller
                          is a natural skin regeneration and Scar Repair Therapy.</p>

                        <strong>Radiofrequency</strong>
                        <p>It’s an energy technology for non-surgical tightening of the early signs of loose or sagging skin; ideal for those people
                          who either don’t want, or don’t believe they are old enough to have a surgical procedure. Radio waves penetrate the skin to
                          activate the collagen growth and rejuvenation of dead cells.</p>

                        <strong>Botox®</strong>
                        <p>Frown lines, crow’s feet and other facial wrinkles often make a person look older and more tired than they actually feel inside.
                          Botox®, a purified form of botulinum toxin, which is approved by the FDA, is an excellent way to treat facial wrinkles. These wrinkles
                          are caused by contraction of the underlying muscles. Botox®relaxes the muscle, therefore; the skin will not show a lot of wrinkles when
                          the muscle is contracted.  Botox®inhibits nerve signals that cause the muscles to contract.</p>

                        <strong>Dysport</strong>
                        <p>Dysport is an anti-aging injectable prepared with abobotulinumtoxinA (Botulinum toxin type A). This Botulinum toxin blocks nerve impulses,
                          causing a temporary reduction in muscle activity when injected into specific areas where constant frowning or squinting has etched creases in
                          the face. Dysport temporarily improves the appearance of moderate to severe frown lines between the
                          eyebrows, worry lines across the forehead, and crow’s feet around the eyes.</p>

                        <strong>Restylane</strong>
                        <p>Restylane® is an injectable filler that adds volume beneath the skin’s surface to lift the skin and soften wrinkles and folds, such as the
                          nasolabial folds (smile lines). Restylane® can also be used to plump the lip and/or its border, deep lines around the lips and eyes, forehead
                          furrows and depressed acne scars.</p>

                        <strong>Juvederm Ultra Plus XC</strong>
                        <p>Juvederm® dermal filler was is used for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles. It’s an injectable filler that consisting of
                          hyaluronic acid, a natural complex sugar that bolsters skin elasticity, providing a smoother and younger appearance. Juvederm® improves your
                          skin’s appearance by lifting and adding volume to the wrinkles and folds. After six to nine months, the biocompatible compound is naturally
                          absorbed into the body.</p>

                        <strong>Juvederm Voluma XC</strong>
                        <p>Injectable gel is for deep injection in the cheek area to correct age-related volume loss in adults over the age of 21. To create a more cheek
                          bone enhancement. This filler can last up to two years.</p>

                        <strong>KYBELLA</strong>
                        <p>What is KYBELLA?</p>

                        <p>KYBELLA® (deoxycholic acid) injection is the first and only FDA-approved injectable treatment that is used in adults to improve the appearance
                        and profile of moderate to severe fat below the chin (submental fat), also called, “double chin.” It is not known if KYBELLA® is safe and effective in children less than 18 years of age. It is not known if KYBELLA® is safe and effective for use outside of the submental area.</p>

                        <p>How does KYBELLA work?</p>
                        <p>The active ingredient in KYBELLA® is deoxycholic acid, a naturally-occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat.
                        When injected into the fat beneath your chin, KYBELLA® causes the destruction of fat cells. Once destroyed, those cells cannot store or accumulate fat.</p>

                        <strong>Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)</strong>
                        <p>Also known as the Vampire Facelift (As Coined by Kim Kardashian), Platelet Rich Plasma is a 100% natural method of non-surgical skin rejuvenation that uses a patient’s own blood components to stimulate the repair and renewal of damaged tissue in areas of the face, neck, décolleté, hands, and body. This protocol has now been proven to be equally effective in the medical aesthetics area. Hence, PRP has become a common skin rejuvenation and anti-aging treatment that reduces wrinkles, sagging and dark circles, while healing skin damaged by acne, injuries and stretch marks.</p>

                        <strong>PRP Hair Loss Therapy</strong>
                        <p>Platelet Rich Plasma injections are a 100% natural, non-surgical treatment for men and women seeking to stimulate hair growth. PRP is concentrated blood plasma that contains up to five times the number of platelets found in normal circulating blood. These platelets contain three different types of growth factor, in addition to other proteins. What’s more, PRP is already used to successfully promote wound healing and facial rejuvenation. And after exhaustive research and clinical trials, it is now proving a successful therapy for stimulating hair growth.</p>

                        <strong>O-Shot® Procedure</strong>
                        <p>The Orgasm Shot® (O-Shot®) procedure is a very specific method of using blood-derived growth factors to rejuvenate the vagina to help relieve women with urinary incontinence and sex problems. Biopsy studies show that when platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is injected, then stem cells multiply and grow new younger tissue. In the same way PRP regenerates the skin of the face, it appears PRP regenerates healthy vaginal tissue. So, using this same technology, the O-Shot® procedure works by using PRP to stimulate stem cells to grow healthier vaginal tissue. And, the whole procedure for processing the blood and injecting the growth factors takes less than 10 minutes in the doctor's office!</p>

                        <strong>Electrocautery</strong>
                        <p>Utilize the passage of high-frequency alternating electrical current through living tissue to achieve varying degrees of tissue destruction.</p>

                        <strong>Lipotropic (M.I.C)</strong>
                        <p>M.I.C is a Slim Shot + B-12, B Complex + L-Carnitine, which is a unique blend of nutrients and makes it a great fat burner and energy Booster for Weight Loss.</p>

                        <strong>B-12 Shot</strong>
                        <p>Vitamin B-12 boosts the healthy functioning of metabolisms and encourages a healthy nervous system.</p>

                        <strong>Carboxytherapy</strong>
                        <p>Carboxyl therapy is a mesotherapy like non-surgical procedure used to infuse CO2 gas below the skin (sub-cutaneous or intradermic) through a thin 30G mesotherapy needle. This treatments are quick, comfortable, effective and with no down time. CO2 gas stimulates blood flow with several consequences: skin elasticity improvement, peau d’orange (orange skin) and cellulite reduction, and localized fat reduction and collagen production stimulation.

                        <p>Electro Muscular Stimulation (EMS) or electric neuromuscular stimulation is the technique that stimulates the muscles’ nerve endings in specific areas through low power electric impulses.

The skin is gently drawn between rollers to stimulate muscles, break down cellulite and fatty deposits, eliminate toxins, improve lymphatic drainage and take inches off. Vacuum therapy also helps restore the skin’s natural elasticity to smooth the appearance of facial wrinkles and “orange-peel” dimpling in the thighs and buttocks. This therapy is painless, safe and highly effective.</p>

The HCG Weight Loss Protocol combines a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) with HCG injections to achieve rapid weight loss. The HCG hormone serves as an appetite suppressant that mitigates hunger and cravings, thereby enabling patients to burn deep-seated visceral fat for energy. La Dolce Vita HCG program is unique because we assess the patient based on body composition, blood test results, and expectations to ensure this is the right diet for the patient and one at which he or she can succeed.</p>

                            <strong>Botox®</strong>
                            <p>Frown lines, crow’s feet and other facial wrinkles often make a person look older and more tired than they actually feel inside.
                              Botox®, a purified form of botulinum toxin, which is approved by the FDA, is an excellent way to treat facial wrinkles. These wrinkles
                              are caused by contraction of the underlying muscles. Botox®relaxes the muscle, therefore; the skin will not show a lot of wrinkles when
                              the muscle is contracted.  Botox®inhibits nerve signals that cause the muscles to contract.</p>

                            <strong>Dysport</strong>
                            <p>Dysport is an anti-aging injectable prepared with abobotulinumtoxinA (Botulinum toxin type A). This Botulinum toxin blocks nerve impulses,
                              causing a temporary reduction in muscle activity when injected into specific areas where constant frowning or squinting has etched creases in
                              the face. Dysport temporarily improves the appearance of moderate to severe frown lines between the
                              eyebrows, worry lines across the forehead, and crow’s feet around the eyes.</p>

                            <strong>Restylane</strong>
                            <p>Restylane® is an injectable filler that adds volume beneath the skin’s surface to lift the skin and soften wrinkles and folds, such as the
                              nasolabial folds (smile lines). Restylane® can also be used to plump the lip and/or its border, deep lines around the lips and eyes, forehead
                              furrows and depressed acne scars.</p>

                            <strong>Juvederm Ultra Plus XC</strong>
                            <p>Juvederm® dermal filler was is used for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles. It’s an injectable filler that consisting of
                              hyaluronic acid, a natural complex sugar that bolsters skin elasticity, providing a smoother and younger appearance. Juvederm® improves your
                              skin’s appearance by lifting and adding volume to the wrinkles and folds. After six to nine months, the biocompatible compound is naturally
                              absorbed into the body.</p>

                            <strong>Juvederm Voluma XC</strong>
                            <p>Injectable gel is for deep injection in the cheek area to correct age-related volume loss in adults over the age of 21. To create a more cheek
                              bone enhancement. This filler can last up to two years.</p>

                            <strong>KYBELLA</strong>
                            <p>What is KYBELLA?</p>

                            <p>KYBELLA® (deoxycholic acid) injection is the first and only FDA-approved injectable treatment that is used in adults to improve the appearance
                            and profile of moderate to severe fat below the chin (submental fat), also called, “double chin.” It is not known if KYBELLA® is safe and effective in children less than 18 years of age. It is not known if KYBELLA® is safe and effective for use outside of the submental area.</p>

                            <p>How does KYBELLA work?</p>
                            <p>The active ingredient in KYBELLA® is deoxycholic acid, a naturally-occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat.
                            When injected into the fat beneath your chin, KYBELLA® causes the destruction of fat cells. Once destroyed, those cells cannot store or accumulate fat.</p>

                            <strong>Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)</strong>
                            <p>Also known as the Vampire Facelift (As Coined by Kim Kardashian), Platelet Rich Plasma is a 100% natural method of non-surgical skin rejuvenation that uses a patient’s own blood components to stimulate the repair and renewal of damaged tissue in areas of the face, neck, décolleté, hands, and body. This protocol has now been proven to be equally effective in the medical aesthetics area. Hence, PRP has become a common skin rejuvenation and anti-aging treatment that reduces wrinkles, sagging and dark circles, while healing skin damaged by acne, injuries and stretch marks.</p>

                            <strong>PRP Hair Loss Therapy</strong>
                            <p>Platelet Rich Plasma injections are a 100% natural, non-surgical treatment for men and women seeking to stimulate hair growth. PRP is concentrated blood plasma that contains up to five times the number of platelets found in normal circulating blood. These platelets contain three different types of growth factor, in addition to other proteins. What’s more, PRP is already used to successfully promote wound healing and facial rejuvenation. And after exhaustive research and clinical trials, it is now proving a successful therapy for stimulating hair growth.</p>

                            <strong>O-Shot® Procedure</strong>
                            <p>The Orgasm Shot® (O-Shot®) procedure is a very specific method of using blood-derived growth factors to rejuvenate the vagina to help relieve women with urinary incontinence and sex problems. Biopsy studies show that when platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is injected, then stem cells multiply and grow new younger tissue. In the same way PRP regenerates the skin of the face, it appears PRP regenerates healthy vaginal tissue. So, using this same technology, the O-Shot® procedure works by using PRP to stimulate stem cells to grow healthier vaginal tissue. And, the whole procedure for processing the blood and injecting the growth factors takes less than 10 minutes in the doctor's office!</p>

                            <strong>Electrocautery</strong>
                            <p>Utilize the passage of high-frequency alternating electrical current through living tissue to achieve varying degrees of tissue destruction.</p>

                              by the defense mechanism of your body as a damage which needs to be repair, and stimulates the release of growth factors that
                              trigger the production of collagen and elastin.</p>

                              who either don’t want, or don’t believe they are old enough to have a surgical procedure. Radio waves penetrate the skin to
                              activate the collagen growth and rejuvenation of dead cells.</p>

                            <strong>Firming Cellulite Leg Treatment</strong>
                            <p>This body contouring treatment starts with dry body brushing to stimulate circulation and assist in the elimination of toxins, followed by an application of our revolutionary body firming crème to tighten and tone loose skin, strengthen collagen fibers and reduce lipid cells eliminating the “orange peel” look associated with cellulite.</p>

                            <strong>Buff and Bronze Body Treatment</strong>
                            <p>Stay sun kissed all year long without the effects of the sun’s harmful rays. This luxurious treatment begins with a full body “buff” utilizing a blend of fruit enzymes, hydroxy acids and skin polishing walnut, to prepare a flawless canvas to paint on our hydrating body bronzer with self-tanning agents derived from sugar protein to leave you with an even bronzed glow.</p>

                            <strong>Ultra Cavitation</strong>
                            <p>Low frequency ultrasound having a power and pressure with a potential 800 times higher to have an effect twice as effective. It’s a different technique but gets better results in less time and with fewer complications and less time for the patient. Cavitation is a novel treatment for reducing fat. Utilizes the latest fat removal technology, which allows it to be used easily and safely. It takes about 8-12 sessions and because the body takes about 72 hours to remove the fat, you have to wait four days between sessions. The result will be seen starting from the third session. This treatment is use for: Reduce located fat / Cellulite / Stretch Mark</p>

                            <strong>Carboxytherapy</strong>
                            <p>Carboxyl therapy is a mesotherapy like non-surgical procedure used to infuse CO2 gas below the skin (sub-cutaneous or intradermic) through a thin 30G mesotherapy needle. This treatments are quick, comfortable, effective and with no down time. CO2 gas stimulates blood flow with several consequences: skin elasticity improvement, peau d’orange (orange skin) and cellulite reduction, and localized fat reduction and collagen production stimulation. Carboxyl therapy is a good alternative to liposuction for people who are not willing to go through anesthesia and surgical operations.</p>

                            <strong>Electro Stimulation</strong>
                            <p>Electro Muscular Stimulation (EMS) or electric neuromuscular stimulation is the technique that stimulates the muscles’ nerve endings in specific areas through low power electric impulses. The contraction movements and relaxation in the stimulated muscles by this type of therapy produce energy expenditure thus reducing fat in the stimulated area and toning.</p>

                            <strong>Vacuum Therapy</strong>
                            <p>The vacuum therapy systems use mechanical suction to deliver a deep massage that rejuvenates the body inside and out. The skin is gently drawn between rollers to stimulate muscles, break down cellulite and fatty deposits, eliminate toxins, improve lymphatic drainage and take inches off. Vacuum therapy also helps restore the skin’s natural elasticity to smooth the appearance of facial wrinkles and “orange-peel” dimpling in the thighs and buttocks. This therapy is painless, safe and highly effective.</p>
