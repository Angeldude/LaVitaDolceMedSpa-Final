        <strong>Botox®</strong>
        <p>Frown lines, crow’s feet and other facial wrinkles often make a person look older and more tired than they actually feel inside.
          Botox®, a purified form of botulinum toxin, which is approved by the FDA, is an excellent way to treat facial wrinkles. These wrinkles
          are caused by contraction of the underlying muscles. Botox®relaxes the muscle, therefore; the skin will not show a lot of wrinkles when
          the muscle is contracted.  Botox®inhibits nerve signals that cause the muscles to contract.</p>

        <strong>Dysport</strong>
        <p>Dysport is an anti-aging injectable prepared with abobotulinumtoxinA (Botulinum toxin type A). This Botulinum toxin blocks nerve impulses,
          causing a temporary reduction in muscle activity when injected into specific areas where constant frowning or squinting has etched creases in
          the face. Dysport temporarily improves the appearance of moderate to severe frown lines between the
          eyebrows, worry lines across the forehead, and crow’s feet around the eyes.</p>

        <strong>Restylane</strong>
        <p>Restylane® is an injectable filler that adds volume beneath the skin’s surface to lift the skin and soften wrinkles and folds, such as the
          nasolabial folds (smile lines). Restylane® can also be used to plump the lip and/or its border, deep lines around the lips and eyes, forehead
          furrows and depressed acne scars.</p>

        <strong>Juvederm Ultra Plus XC</strong>
        <p>Juvederm® dermal filler was is used for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles. It’s an injectable filler that consisting of
          hyaluronic acid, a natural complex sugar that bolsters skin elasticity, providing a smoother and younger appearance. Juvederm® improves your
          skin’s appearance by lifting and adding volume to the wrinkles and folds. After six to nine months, the biocompatible compound is naturally
          absorbed into the body.</p>

        <strong>Juvederm Voluma XC</strong>
        <p>Injectable gel is for deep injection in the cheek area to correct age-related volume loss in adults over the age of 21. To create a more cheek
          bone enhancement. This filler can last up to two years.</p>

        <strong>KYBELLA</strong>
        <p>What is KYBELLA?</p>

        <p>KYBELLA® (deoxycholic acid) injection is the first and only FDA-approved injectable treatment that is used in adults to improve the appearance
        and profile of moderate to severe fat below the chin (submental fat), also called, “double chin.” It is not known if KYBELLA® is safe and effective in children less than 18 years of age. It is not known if KYBELLA® is safe and effective for use outside of the submental area.</p>

        <p>How does KYBELLA work?</p>
        <p>The active ingredient in KYBELLA® is deoxycholic acid, a naturally-occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat.
        When injected into the fat beneath your chin, KYBELLA® causes the destruction of fat cells. Once destroyed, those cells cannot store or accumulate fat.</p>

        <strong>Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)</strong>
        <p>Also known as the Vampire Facelift (As Coined by Kim Kardashian), Platelet Rich Plasma is a 100% natural method of non-surgical skin rejuvenation that uses a patient’s own blood components to stimulate the repair and renewal of damaged tissue in areas of the face, neck, décolleté, hands, and body. This protocol has now been proven to be equally effective in the medical aesthetics area. Hence, PRP has become a common skin rejuvenation and anti-aging treatment that reduces wrinkles, sagging and dark circles, while healing skin damaged by acne, injuries and stretch marks.</p>

        <strong>PRP Hair Loss Therapy</strong>
        <p>Platelet Rich Plasma injections are a 100% natural, non-surgical treatment for men and women seeking to stimulate hair growth. PRP is concentrated blood plasma that contains up to five times the number of platelets found in normal circulating blood. These platelets contain three different types of growth factor, in addition to other proteins. What’s more, PRP is already used to successfully promote wound healing and facial rejuvenation. And after exhaustive research and clinical trials, it is now proving a successful therapy for stimulating hair growth.</p>

        <strong>O-Shot® Procedure</strong>
        <p>The Orgasm Shot® (O-Shot®) procedure is a very specific method of using blood-derived growth factors to rejuvenate the vagina to help relieve women with urinary incontinence and sex problems. Biopsy studies show that when platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is injected, then stem cells multiply and grow new younger tissue. In the same way PRP regenerates the skin of the face, it appears PRP regenerates healthy vaginal tissue. So, using this same technology, the O-Shot® procedure works by using PRP to stimulate stem cells to grow healthier vaginal tissue. And, the whole procedure for processing the blood and injecting the growth factors takes less than 10 minutes in the doctor's office!</p>

        <strong>Electrocautery</strong>
        <p>Utilize the passage of high-frequency alternating electrical current through living tissue to achieve varying degrees of tissue destruction.</p>

        <strong>Lipotropic (M.I.C)</strong>
        <p>M.I.C is a Slim Shot + B-12, B Complex + L-Carnitine, which is a unique blend of nutrients and makes it a great fat burner and energy Booster for Weight Loss.</p>

        <strong>B-12 Shot</strong>
        <p>Vitamin B-12 boosts the healthy functioning of metabolisms and encourages a healthy nervous system.</p>

The skin is gently drawn between rollers to stimulate muscles, break down cellulite and fatty deposits,lift buttocks, eliminate toxins, improve lymphatic drainage and take inches off. Vacuum therapy also helps restore the skin’s natural elasticity. This therapy is painless, safe and highly effective.</p>
